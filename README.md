# gomycode-asynchronous-programming
# Async/Await Checkpoint Project

This project demonstrates key concepts of `async/await` in JavaScript, including iterating with async/await, handling API calls, error handling, and managing concurrent requests.

## Tasks Implemented

### Task 01: Iterating with Async/Await
Logs each value from an array with a delay of 1 second between logs.

### Task 02: Awaiting a Call
Simulates an API call and uses `await` to handle the asynchronous response.

### Task 03: Handling Errors with Async/Await
Modifies the API call to gracefully handle errors using a `try-catch` block.

### Task 04: Awaiting Concurrent Requests
Demonstrates concurrent API requests using `Promise.all()` and logs combined results.
